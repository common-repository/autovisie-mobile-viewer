Widget with the mobile version of your website for editors

== Description ==

Tired of testing on multiple devices? We give you the future! üòâ Our editors at Autovisie.nl carefully checking the preview of their articles‚Ä¶ on desktop. Not nifty, cause a large percentage of our readers are visiting Autovisie.nl via mobile phone. Tadaa: That‚Äôs why we built the mobile preview.

= Why we built it =
This is a useful tool to to directly preview your website for a small screen like a mobile phone. ‚ÄúHello Maarten, WordPress already built an mobile preview.‚Äù Yep, indeed, but that‚Äôs only backend. Our free plugin provides a preview after you saved your story.

Create posts, pages or even custom posts types and check instantly how it would look like, a big time saver for editors!

Based on the WordPress Boilterplate that can be found on http://wppb.io/.
